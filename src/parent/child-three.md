###[Link to project on github](https://github.com/ejmg/open-sec-data)
I am currently collaborating on a project that would scrape and analyze data released by the SEC en masse in a user-friendly manner. In it's current state, the program scrapes all data held by the SEC. Future developments will provide ways to sustainably host, parse, and visualize multiple terabytes of corporate data.
