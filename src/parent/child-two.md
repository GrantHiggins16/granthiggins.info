Benjamin Graham is widely considered to be one of the pioneers of value investing. He believed that any potential investor's focus when deciding to buy stock in a company should be the value of that company. In this project, I implemented his equation to estimate a companies value and compared the numbers I got to the actual market value of those companies' stocks. This allowed me to get valuable investment information for over 6000 companies who have their tickers listed in the NYSE and the NASDAQ. 

The project in it's current state appears to have some issues stemming from the Yahoo Finance API. As such, some of the extreme Graham values given should be considered useless. However, the vast majority of tickers scraped still provide useful information.
